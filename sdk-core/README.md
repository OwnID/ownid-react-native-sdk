## What is OwnID?
OwnID offers a passwordless login alternative to a website by using cryptographic keys to replace the traditional password. The public part of a key is stored in the website's identity platform while the private part is stored on the mobile device. With OwnID, the userâ€™s phone becomes their method of login.
When a user registers for an account on their phone, selecting Skip Password is all that is needed to store the private key on the phone. As a result, as long as they are logging in on their phone, selecting Skip Password logs the user into the site automatically. If the user accesses the website on a desktop, they register and log in by using their mobile device to scan a QR code. Enhanced security is available by incorporating biometrics or other multi-factor authentication methods into the registration and login process.
