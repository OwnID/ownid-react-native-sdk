# OwnID React Native Core SDK

The [OwnID](https://ownid.com/) React Native SDK is a client library that provides a passwordless login alternative for your React Native application by using cryptographic keys to replace the traditional password. The SDK allows the user to perform Registration and Login flows in a React Native application.

The React Native Core module wraps native [Android Core](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-android-sdk) and [iOS Core](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-ios-sdk) modules that provide core functionality like setting up an OwnID configuration, performing network calls to the OwnID server, interacting with a browser, handling a redirect URI, and checking and returning results to the application.
