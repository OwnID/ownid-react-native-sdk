## OwnID React Native Core SDK

The [OwnID](https://ownid.com) React Native Core SDK is a client library that provides a passwordless login add-on for your React Native application that uses biometric (FaceID, Fingerprint, passcode, etc) authentication to replace the traditional password. During registration or login, users can choose to use their phones to authenticate instead of using a password. The userâ€™s phone becomes their login method, protected by the phone unlock mechanism (FaceID, Fingerprint, passcode, etc).

The OwnID React Native Core SDK wraps native [OwnID Android Core](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-android-sdk) and [OwnID iOS Core](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-core-ios-sdk) SDKs that provides core functionality.
