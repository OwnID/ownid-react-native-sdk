### OwnID React Native Core SDK
The [OwnID](https://ownid.com/) React Native SDK is a client library offering a secure and passwordless login alternative for your React Native applications. It leverages [Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.com/) to replace conventional passwords, fostering enhanced authentication methods and empowers users to seamlessly execute Registration and Login flows within their React Native applications.

Documentation available at [https://docs.ownid.com](https://docs.ownid.com) and [https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-react-native-sdk](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-react-native-sdk)

## Data Safety
The OwnID SDK collects data and information about events inside the SDK using Log Data. This Log Data does not include any personal data that can be used to identify the user such as username, email, and password. It does include general information like the device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device model, operating system version, time and date of events, and other statistics.

Log Data is sent to the OwnID server using an encrypted process so it can be used to collect OwnID service statistics and improve service quality. OwnID does not share Log Data with any third party services.
