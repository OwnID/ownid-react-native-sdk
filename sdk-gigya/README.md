# OwnID React Native Gigya SDK

The OwnID React Native Gigya SDK integrates with Email/Password-based [Gigya Authentication](https://github.com/SAP/gigya-android-sdk).

The [OwnID](https://ownid.com/) React Native Gigya SDK is a client library that provides a passwordless login alternative for your React Native application by using cryptographic keys to replace the traditional password. The SDK allows the user to perform Registration and Login flows in a React Native application. The SDK is available from the npm repository.
