## OwnID React Native Gigya SDK

The [OwnID](https://ownid.com) React Native Gigya SDK is a client library that provides a passwordless login add-on for your React Native application that uses biometric (FaceID, Fingerprint, passcode, etc) authentication to replace the traditional password. During registration or login, users can choose to use their phones to authenticate instead of using a password. The userâ€™s phone becomes their login method, protected by the phone unlock mechanism (FaceID, Fingerprint, passcode, etc).

OwnID React Native Gigya SDK extends [OwnID React Native Core SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ownid/react-native-core) functionality by providing integration with [Gigya Authentication](https://github.com/SAP/gigya-android-sdk) and is based on native [OwnID Android Gigya](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-android-sdk) and [OwnID iOS Gigya](https://github.com/OwnID/ownid-gigya-ios-sdk) SDKs.
